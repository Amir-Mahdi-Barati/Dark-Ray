# DarkRay RGB Controller

## Project Overview
This project is an Arduino-based RGB LED strip controller with NeoPixel LEDs and an OLED display.  
The interface includes buttons and a rotary encoder for easy navigation through menus to select colors, effects, and settings such as speed and brightness.
